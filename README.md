# Weather-Voice-Assistant
A weather voice assistant project is a voice-activated program that provides users with real-time weather information. The assistant uses speech recognition to understand user commands, retrieves weather data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap), and then relays that information back to the user through text-to-speech or by displaying it on a screen.
